            <p class="pop"><br>"Life is getting tougher day by day, the one who never quits make it easier someday"<br><br>

              Recently, one of my friend asked me for motivation. And i wasn't able to reply properly,
              mostly because I don't give motivational speeches or engage in such activities.<br>
              But now,I think that there is something I need to share. <br>
              <strong>OH SORRY!</strong> don't think that it's a motivational article. Consider it as my proper reply.<br><br>
              
                             People today experience mental exhaustion more frequently than in the past.<br>
              hmm..... I really don't know why. But when i give it a thought, maybe it's because people are doing the same thing everyday.
              Nothing creative is happening. Just going to college/ work , wasting too much time in social media's, sacrifising your sleep for movies/series, overthinking etc......<br>
              <strong>OKAY LEAVE IT.</strong> Now let me ask you something,<br> What happened to the creative part?  or What happen to your passion that you always wanted to follow ?<br><br>
              
              Yaa !! i know <strong>too busy,</strong> right?<br>
              My friend was seeking confidence to take decisions, thinking that something might go wrong.<br>
              <strong>OK WAIT,</strong> Making a decision does not imply that it must always be the right one. Take a successful football player as an example; he makes important judgments while on the field. It works and doesn't work occasionally.
              It depends on his level of experience. He will fail trying, but that's good since experience isn't something that can be earned quickly. Eventually, he will be in charge of his team. Life is just like that; in order to succeed, we must gain knowledge and experience. Experience is gained by going through it, not by reading about it.<br>
              
              So simply take a chance, do what you want, and always be engaged.<br><br>
              
              There isn't a single person who can motivate you better than yourself. How hard I try or someone else try, Its your thing to be motivated, not mine.
              Its funny seeing Youtube thumbnails like "This is the best motivation", "This is what you need", "Ten motivational tips",lol.....
              Trust me that isn't motivation, They are just boosters that works for 1 or 2 days. The real motivation is inside you that 
              continuously tells you <strong>"not to GIVE UP".</strong><br><br>
              
              For me, there is a particular incident that constantly motivates me. It's a bit tough to describe, when I was in the Xth grade, I basically created a fuss and let my parents down that too in front of my class teacher. Even if those memories make me crazy, teary, furious, and aggressive, it's good because they only <strong>KEEPS MY SPIRIT BURNING.</strong><br><br>
              
              I believe it's okay at times to feel depressed since doing so is exactly how you strive to get to know yourself, ask questions, and discover solutions.<br><br>
              
              Please consider this to be <strong>"MY PROPER REPLY"</strong> even if it is a bit lengthy (sorry) and seems more like a motivational article.<br><br>

            <p class="pop"><br>Can you beleieve it ? When I say We grew faster than we think. Ya I know, most of us already feels that. For me, Its really nostalgic. I still remember the day I started going to kindergarten, holding my parents hand, playng with kindergarten stuffs, crying because they left. Oh ya, I remember I was such a crybaby. And now, the same crybaby leaving everything and trying to run faster , chasing big dreams. Still, I can't believe that I'm currently enrolled in college. You know, It's mainly because of the damn pandemic. Most of the students of my age understands that , It's a bit funnny - "for us we are still In Xth" waiting to get a proper Higher secondary Education. <br>When elders talk about their old days their college life, school life, childhood everything really excites me. But I never thought that I will be In the same shoes thinking about my life. Ya I know, Its not same for everyone. But <strong>CHILDHOOD</strong> , <strong>golden age </strong>that most misses, makes us really nostalgic. The school days- In which we shared cool stuffs, Comics, Wimpykid, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean. Ohhhh Yeaaa , How can i forget "GRAND THEFT AUTO" really was something special for us. Picnics , Cousins , fights , secrets. The golden age I refered was something else, Such golden memories-------- <strong>REALLY WANT TO GO BACK</strong>.<br>But the sad reality is that its over.<br><br> What are we now ?, Ladies and Gentlemen trying to survive in this unfair and corrupted society. Busy making our lifestyle better day by day.<br><br>Passing through different stages in life from the day we born to the day we lay in ground we experience different things, But what does it gives us ? what's special about it ? And finally what will we achieve ?<br>
              I know, these are very common and at the same time important questions we have ,right ?<br>I think, maybe that's Life for. <strong>WE NEED TO FIND THE ANSWERS</strong> ourselves.<br>Don't rush searching, <center><strong>"Life is about moments, so make them last forever".</strong></center></p>
