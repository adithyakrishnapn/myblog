            <p class="pop"><br><br>Hey,<br>
              <br><br>
              Day by day things are getting so good.<br>
              I was so busy, but so satisfied.<br><br>
              
              It's been a few weeks, since I wrote something. <br>
              But I was so satisfied by publishing my first ebook. Things are getting so productive lately.
              Within a month we will be launching our own multimedia company.
              People will ask why multimedia ? you now, Thats the only thing that we can afford or think for now....
              I know it won't be a grand success or anything but it will definitely increase our 
              experience and skill. <br><br>
              
              Hey, its not about money. it's about the effort that I put to earn the money that matters.<br><br>
              I know most of us are feeling so low these days. I know how it feels to be alone. But I say it's OKAY.
              You should know this "You rise only from the lower levels". Most of you want to be productive, but you'r mind is so disturbed,
              or is full of confusions. Ya, I'm not a motivational speaker or something to let you out of that situation but I just need to
              tell you this, You should know this , the satisfaction I had after publishing my own ebook. It was so good, I really mean it. 
              You should feel it , the moment after achieving something that was inside your head for a long time.....

            <p class="pop"></p><strong class="pop"><center>LETS FIND THE ANSWERS</center></strong></p>
            <p class="pop"><br>Can you beleieve it ? When I say We grew faster than we think. Ya I know, most of us already feels that. For me, Its really nostalgic. I still remember the day I started going to kindergarten, holding my parents hand, playng with kindergarten stuffs, crying because they left. Oh ya, I remember I was such a crybaby. And now, the same crybaby leaving everything and trying to run faster , chasing big dreams. Still, I can't believe that I'm currently enrolled in college. You know, It's mainly because of the damn pandemic. Most of the students of my age understands that , It's a bit funnny - "for us we are still In Xth" waiting to get a proper Higher secondary Education. <br>When elders talk about their old days their college life, school life, childhood everything really excites me. But I never thought that I will be In the same shoes thinking about my life. Ya I know, Its not same for everyone. But <strong>CHILDHOOD</strong> , <strong>golden age </strong>that most misses, makes us really nostalgic. The school days- In which we shared cool stuffs, Comics, Wimpykid, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean. Ohhhh Yeaaa , How can i forget "GRAND THEFT AUTO" really was something special for us. Picnics , Cousins , fights , secrets. The golden age I refered was something else, Such golden memories-------- <strong>REALLY WANT TO GO BACK</strong>.<br>But the sad reality is that its over.<br><br> What are we now ?, Ladies and Gentlemen trying to survive in this unfair and corrupted society. Busy making our lifestyle better day by day.<br><br>Passing through different stages in life from the day we born to the day we lay in ground we experience different things, But what does it gives us ? what's special about it ? And finally what will we achieve ?<br>
              I know, these are very common and at the same time important questions we have ,right ?<br>I think, maybe that's Life for. <strong>WE NEED TO FIND THE ANSWERS</strong> ourselves.<br>Don't rush searching, <center><strong>"Life is about moments, so make them last forever".</strong></center></p>

              <p class="pop"><strong>BLOG : 2</strong></p><br>
              <p class="pop"></p><strong class="pop"><center>MY PROPER REPLY</center></strong></p>
              <p class="pop"><br>"Life is getting tougher day by day, the one who never quits make it easier someday"<br><br>
  
                Recently, one of my friends asked me for motivation. And i wasn't able to reply properly,
                mostly because I don't give motivational speeches or engage in such activities.<br>
                But now,I think that there is something I need to share. <br>
                <strong>OH SORRY!</strong> don't think that it's a motivational article. Consider it as my proper reply.<br><br>
                
                               People today experience mental exhaustion more frequently than in the past.<br>
                hmm..... I really don't know why. But when i give it a thought, maybe it's because people are doing the same thing everyday.
                Nothing creative is happening. Just going to college/ work , wasting too much time in social media's, sacrifising your sleep for movies/series, overthinking etc......<br>
                <strong>OKAY LEAVE IT.</strong> Now let me ask you something,<br> What happened to the creative part?  or What happen to your passion that you always wanted to follow ?<br><br>
                
                Yaa !! i know <strong>too busy,</strong> right?<br>
                My friend was seeking confidence to take decisions, thinking that something might go wrong.<br>
                <strong>OK WAIT,</strong> Making a decision does not imply that it must always be the right one. Take a successful football player as an example; he makes important judgments while on the field. It works and doesn't work occasionally.
                It depends on his level of experience. He will fail trying, but that's good since experience isn't something that can be earned quickly. Eventually, he will be in charge of his team. Life is just like that; in order to succeed, we must gain knowledge and experience. Experience is gained by going through it, not by reading about it.<br>
                
                So simply take a chance, do what you want, and always be engaged.<br><br>
                
                There isn't a single person who can motivate you better than yourself. How hard I try or someone else try, Its your thing to be motivated, not mine.
                Its funny seeing Youtube thumbnails like "This is the best motivation", "This is what you need", "Ten motivational tips",lol.....
                Trust me that isn't motivation, They are just boosters that works for 1 or 2 days. The real motivation is inside you that 
                continuously tells you <strong>"not to GIVE UP".</strong><br><br>
                
                For me, there is a particular incident that constantly motivates me. It's a bit tough to describe, when I was in the Xth grade, I basically created a fuss and let my parents down that too in front of my class teacher. Even if those memories make me crazy, teary, furious, and aggressive, it's good because they only <strong>KEEPS MY SPIRIT BURNING.</strong><br><br>
                
                I believe it's okay at times to feel depressed since doing so is exactly how you strive to get to know yourself, ask questions, and discover solutions.<br><br>
                
                Please consider this to be <strong>"MY PROPER REPLY"</strong> even if it is a bit lengthy (sorry) and seems more like a motivational article.<br><br>
                <center><strong>"You dont need to seek motivation , Its already inside you. Just let it burn"</strong></center></p>

              <p class="pop"><strong>BLOG : 3</strong></p><br>
              <p class="pop"></p><strong class="pop"><center>SORRY AND THANKYOU</center></strong></p>
              <p class="pop"><br>                            <strong>S</strong>orry and Thankyou, these words are getting so rare nowadays. Most of you wont agree to this. But just think about it, people
                of this era are more egotistical and don't give a thing about others, "Why should I apologize?,let him/her do it.","Is there 
                any reason to show grattitude,Do I really need to ?" - these are so common now. <br>You might think that I'm talking bullshit ,Sometimes I do feel the same :)lol.<br>
                OK now let me be frank, I'm a victim of this egotistical era and a person who carry pain(more like regrets) of having the above mentioned attitude.<br>So thats the exact reason why I'm writing this blog.<br><br>
                
                
                
                Days back, when I was in high school I was a boy who don't give a thing about others . For me its just me and only me, Like I never tried to understand others ,Used to take people lightly, more materialistic...Ya, so Boring.
                So back then, I had a friend in my tution named Anandhu, <strong>THEY</strong> had a seperate team .They weren't my type and I never considered them to be my actual friends, For me they were just temporary guys with whom I need to stick for a while.<br>
                Day's passed and I still gave them my ATTITUDE, But we really started to enjoy moments together. WHAT I DID WAS, I JUST BECAME A FAKE PERSON.
                Almost an year passed, And everything changed. I started to like them, especially him - ANANDHU - mainly because he had a beautiful soul , Even if i wasn't treating him properly he did treated me <strong>so nicely</strong>.<br>
                
                I always wanted to say sorry for the way I behaved, But my ego never let me apologize. <br><br>
                
                HaHa... now you guys might think -- "So what ?, I can apologize now". You Know I really wish to, but after a few months I got a call from my friend's mom saying that he is "NO MORE".
                <strong>Booooommm</strong> .... He committed suicide. I dont know why, But he got real problems thats the only thing I know. And I  never tried to help him, not even once. 
                
                <strong>THE NEWS HIT ME SO BADLY</strong>, I was stuck for a while Then I cried and with the sadly pounding heart, <strong>I said "SORRY"</strong>.<br>
                And atlast the only thing remained was regret..<strong>"PURE REGRET"</strong>.<br><br>
                
                After this incident I always did apologized , almost to everything...
                
                Hey, I'm not telling you to <strong>GO APOLOGIZE ALWAYS</strong>.But when you feel to, don't hesitate because sometimes you wont get a second chance.<br>
                
                The one important thing He taught me was , "Showing gratitude is not repaying debt, Its just sharing love".<br><br><center><strong>“There are no regrets in life, just lessons.”</strong><br>-Jennifer Aniston</center></p>

                <div id="blog4">
                  <p class="pop"><strong>BLOG : 4</strong></p><br>
                  <p class="pop"></p><strong class="pop"><center>SOLUTION</center></strong></p>
                  <p class="pop"><br><br>
                    Hey... I was a bit busy with my exams, thats why I wasn't able to write for a while.<br>
                    <strong>L</strong>ast day I had a situation like, One of my friends was so upset,because he was badly scolded by his father for investing money in stocks.And guess what ? I had to calm him down :[ by talking bullshits].
                    <br>So this blog is all about my response/answer towards the question Why parents are getting too tensed while we say "I started to earn money", or if we say "I started a small online business" 
                    or "I started to invest in stocks/trading".<br><br>
                    
                    First of all I'm not a greedy or a selfish person who loves money more than anything, to speak on this topic. But I really love making money, or doing businesses, It feels so good when I do something productive and earn real cash or using our brain to create passive income.
                    <br>Okay, now let me come to the topic, Most middle class families react so tensed or afraid when a topic like this comes up.
                    I know the exact reason why they react like that, It's because <strong>fear</strong>, fear of spoiling their childs future / studies.
                    
                    <br><br>My parents don't support any of this, my father always scolds me for doing such stuffs - like earning money.
                    Most parents want their child to have a degree and work for a company or an organization , And after gathering more experience shift to another company which provides you with more salary.
                    And at last retire as a person working on a high position so that "We, the children can make our future generations safe".
                    
                    <br><br>Yea, I know these are all problems "What about the solutions ?". It's funny, I don't have a proper solution for this :). We can't change their attitudes, It's so difficult.
                    But I think rather than changing them, It's better we change. Change means adjusting ourselves in a way which we satisfy our parents and at the same time we do what we love to, You know what I mean ;)..
                    Hey!! Just Remember -- Get a degree or achieve a skill that will be handy in the future, not to satisfy your current needs. I know I'm not a successful person to give advice or motivations, As I said before I am just an ordinary student chasing big dreams.And these are all my findings/conclusion based on several researches.
                    
                    <br>I don't care If I fail doing something that I love to. 
                    You Know why ?, because "I TRIED". <br><br>
                    
                    I know, Most won't find this blog that interesting, but it's something that I felt sharing.<br>
                    And one more thing - I have a question for you guys,<br>
                    "Why do you want to make money? " - Answer me if you can.</p>

                  <div id="blog5">
                    <p class="pop"><strong>BLOG : 5</strong></p><br>
                    <p class="pop"></p><strong class="pop"><center>COMPROMISE-NEVER</center></strong></p>
                    <p class="pop"><br><br>Hello,<br>
                      <strong>I</strong> wasn't able to write for a while because I had Semester exams.<br>
                      But now I'm free.....<br>
                      Lot of things happend, I was into deep things and was so depressed of it. I really lost
                      confidence and was so tired. But then I realized that there is no need for me to stay like this, I have
                      been through such situations before.<br><br> 
                      
                      Problem is that I compromised my policy of being truthful that I promised  myself not to break.<br>
                      Ya, everything went wrong. But It's okay, I consider it as a phase in my life (Like a chapter).<br>We should not compromise ourselves 
                      no matter what . We are who we are, dare to face the problems being yourself. I always wanted people to love me, rather not hate me.
                      but the truth is that we can't make everyone like us or think favourably of us.<br> The only thing that we all should remember is
                      that we should be truthful towards ourselves, whenever something goes wrong ~ ask yourselves, was it right ? If not go make it right 
                      or apologize for what you did. Most of the time you wont get an second chance but if you get one, NEVER WASTE IT.<br><br>
                      
                      Ok now leave such things,I would like to share something thats currently in my mind. When I first started writing blog 
                      I was full of Energy and contents/subjects, But now when I give it a thought I feel like I don't have anything 
                      to share / or like my memory is completely drained, And also not having enough time to write blogs.
                      People say that if you have something in your mind which can be executed or more like productive stuffs,
                      They say just start it . Starting such idea is the only difficult part and else will come through the flow.
                      But I comletely disagree with that , Starting is difficult then maintaining is much more difficult and at last getting successful is much much much more dificult.<br>
                      
                      Now I made my mind, I wont strop writing blogs because  atleast I need to complete something that I had started.
                      <br><br>
                      2022 taught me that you can modify yourself but never compromise yourself. Life is a oneway track so never regret for what you do.
                      Be truthful and honest in any situation. And one more thing "If your deeds are good, Then people will definitely stay with you. Not so quick but definitely someday".</p>

                    <p class="pop"><br><br>Hey,<br>
                      Happy new year :)<br><br>

                      This year is so special for me, because we were having a blast on new year...<br>
                      SORRY not Bomb blast :]. While people are searching for resolutions, I'm sure that this year is the beginning
                      of a new era for me, I feel like I'm so lucky that I got the best new year of all.<br><br>
                      
                      I was so busy improving my skills and thinking of ideas to start an online business. <br>
                      Yes !! I got one and I was trying to build a platform on my own. But it's not working :\  <br>
                      But It's okay I won't quit that easily. I was trying to form a team/group, So that we can work together but It isn't easy to create
                      one though. I'm so busy these days, that I don't get enough time to write blogs or any other thing. Whenever I'm free I just write
                      something that I want to share. <br><br>
                      
                      The one thing that I want to share is that the age between 19 - 22 is so important. We have try so hard.<br>
                      You know why ? <br>
                      We start to face the reality that we were wasting time, In this age period we have to do something productive or else we
                      won't be able to do anything productive -- I mean life long (It completey depends on our mindset)...... We need to try and Its okay to fail.<br>
                      If you want to be something, start now. I'm sure someday India will be full of productive/creative people, so that nobody
                      leaves India to have a better lifestyle. <br>We all should realize that its our nation and it's our responsibility to make 
                      our nation better.

                    <p class="pop"></p><strong class="pop"><center>SATISFIED</center></strong></p>
                    <p class="pop"><br><br>Hey,<br>
                      <br><br>

                      Day by day things are getting so good.<br>
                      I was so busy, but so satisfied.<br><br>
                      
                      It's been a few weeks, since I wrote something. <br>
                      But I was so satisfied by publishing my first ebook. Things are getting so productive lately.
                      Within a month we will be launching our own multimedia company.
                      People will ask why multimedia ? you now, Thats the only thing that we can afford or think for now....
                      I know it won't be a grand success or anything but it will definitely increase our 
                      experience and skill. <br><br>
                      
                      Hey, its not about money. it's about the effort that I put to earn the money that matters.<br><br>
                      I know most of us are feeling so low these days. I know how it feels to be alone. But I say it's OKAY.
                      You should know this "You rise only from the lower levels". Most of you want to be productive, but you'r mind is so disturbed,
                      or is full of confusions. Ya, I'm not a motivational speaker or something to let you out of that situation but I just need to
                      tell you this, You should know this , the satisfaction I had after publishing my own ebook. It was so good, I really mean it. 
                      You should feel it , the moment after achieving something that was inside your head for a long time.....
                      </p>
